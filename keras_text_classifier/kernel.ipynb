    "# **How to train your <del>dragon</del> custom word embeddings**\n\nIn the [baseline-keras-lstm-is-all-you-need](https://www.kaggle.com/huikang/baseline-keras-lstm-is-all-you-need) notebook shared by Hui Kang (thanks again!), it was demonstrated that a LSTM model using generic global vector (GLOVE) achieved a pretty solid benchmark results.\n\nAfter playing around with GLOVE, you will quickly find that certain words in your training data are not present in its vocab. These are typically replaced with same-shape zero vector, which essentially means you are 'sacrificing' the word as your input feature, which can potentially be important for correct prediction. Another way to deal with this is to train your own word embeddings, using your training data, so that the semantic relationship of your own training corpus can be better represented.\n\nIn this notebook, I will demonstrate how to train your custom word2vec using Gensim.\n\nFor those who are new to word embeddings and would like to find out more, you can check out the following articles:\n1.
